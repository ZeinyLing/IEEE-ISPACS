<b>AI-based Computer-aided System on Long Term Care</b><br><br>
<b>Abstract</b><br>
According to data from Taiwanâ€™s National Development Council in 2024, Taiwan is expected to enter a super-aged society by 2025, indicating a great acceleration in population aging. With the aging population and the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases, the importance of rehabilitation for the elderly has become crucial. Rehabilitation aims not only to aid in recovering from illness or surgery but also to maintain health in daily life. For the elderly, appropriate rehabilitation exercises can improve physical strength, cardiopulmonary function, and overall quality of life. This not only helps restore physical function but also reduces the occurrence and progression of chronic diseases. The system includes contextual rehabilitation games, general rehabilitation training, accessible remote instruction, and physical fitness assessment. The contextual rehabilitation games utilize gamified interactive designs to enhance engagement and motivation. General rehabilitation training provides standardized guidance on rehabilitation movements. Accessible remote instruction allows patients who are unable to move due to various factors to receive professional guidance in hospitals or care centers, reducing the inconvenience of movement. Finally, physical fitness assessment provides accurate data support for medical personnel, while also reducing manual calculation errors and labor costs. Through this comprehensive assistive system, smart healthcare can not only improve the effectiveness and efficiency of rehabilitation but also provide a new approach for health management and rehabilitation of the elderly, helping to address the challenges brought by an aging society in the future.
